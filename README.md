Group-Project-1

Project pseudocode (Story Page):

This page start by displaying the first sentence of the story. a.

The user is asked to enter one more sentence. 
  a. The line is sent to the DB and stored. 
  b. The story content (new line plus all the previous lines) are displayed on all players' computer.

When the user hits enter, the line is appended to the story. Multiple Sentences will be added by the users. 
  a. Maximum Lines is 5.

Things to Determine:

The number of connections that are registered into the game we need to limit the number of players to make sure they take turns, we need to control so that every player is allowed one turn at a time.
When the lines reach 10, all users are alerted alerted "this is the ending, put ending to the story".  
  -The user's sentence becomes the end of the story.

Final Package:

  Display full story with giphs like a story book.
  Sound API will read off the story.
